# Energy-Freedom
/*Home energy and IoT
Energy use in the home with pwer from solar, generator and the grid.  The system will include a home battery, an Arduino controller,
a displays and control panel, contactors, and electronics.  The intention is to access the Arduino, the battery and the solar inverters to 
extract data that could be used on a PC to display historic data in spreadhseets, graphs and charts as well as realtime energy flows.  
The challenge is optimization of energy using efficiency and load management based on solar panel output, time of day, season and other 
factors.  Use of the generator or the grid to augment the solar power, in some optimal and cost efficient way, is the end item software 
requirement.  Data logging of historic performance is central.  It is recognized this is a longer term hobby development that may never
be finished as new ideas, new technoligies and new products become available.  Milestones along the way will use the operational code with the use of simulation and software development on a seperate platform.   Of course, having remote access to some performance 
information is required but I am not certain if remote command and control should even be considered due to hacker mayhem.  
It is the trip that is important.*/
